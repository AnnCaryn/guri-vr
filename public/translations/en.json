The main tool that follows the goal is the online editor which is described below but Guri attempts to make the job easy in different ways. For example, it is possible to create a basic 360 panorama that works in the browser and with headsets like the Google Cardboard just by tweeting the picture with a mention to <a href='https://twitter.com/guri_vr'>@guri_vr</a>.",
